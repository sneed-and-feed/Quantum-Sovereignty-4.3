# 🛡️ QUANTUM SOVEREIGNTY v3.3: AUDIT PROTOCOLS

**Status:** STABLE (Pleroma Stack)
**Genesis Hash:** `d2eb1cc2`
**Sovereign Seed:** `LATERALUS_PHI` (Deterministic)

## 1. THE ROSETTA STONE (Translation Layer)
To ensure transparency for non-initiates, the following mapping defines the Gnostic Nomenclature in standard technical terms.

| Gnostic Term | Technical Implementation | File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The GhostMesh** | 27-Node Volumetric Grid (3x3x3 Topology) | `ghostmesh.py` |
| **12D Hardening** | Vector Symbolic Architecture (HDC) / Tensor Field | `hyper_sovereign.py` |
| **Lindblad Engine** | Dissipative Quantum Neural Network (DQNN) Solver | `dissipative.py` |
| **Lei Protocol** | Procedural Entity Generation based on Entropy | `lei_summon.py` |
| **Archon Scan** | Zero-Dependency & Port Binding Verification | `sovereign_cli.py` |
| **Stargates** | Conditional `torch` / `numpy` Export Interfaces | `gateways.py` |

---

## 2. CLI INTERFACE & SAFETY
The binary contains embedded documentation and safety checks accessible via standard flags.

### **Reveal the Word (Manifesto)**
Extracts the embedded philosophical constraints and build metadata.
```bash
python sovereign_cli.py --manifesto
```
Expected Output: Prints the "Apocrypha" text and the Build Timestamp/Hash.

### **Verify Sovereignty (Safety Audit)**
Runs a runtime analysis of the environment to confirm no unauthorized network sockets or telemetry hooks are active.
```bash
python sovereign_cli.py --safety-audit
```
Expected Output: `SYSTEM STATUS: SOVEREIGN. NO LEAKS DETECTED.`

## 3. DETERMINISTIC REPRODUCIBILITY (The Vigils)

All "Rituals" (Unit Tests) are seeded with `random.seed("LATERALUS_PHI")` to ensure that the 12D geometry unfolds identically on all hardware.

### **Run the Test Suite**
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_rituals.py
```

### **Invariant Thresholds**
| Metric | Target Value | Tolerance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LuoShu Constant | 15.0 | ± 0.001 |
| Reality Density | 1.0 | > 0.8 |
| Dozenal Sum | 144.0 (Gross) | ± 1.618 (Tau) |

## 4. PROVENANCE & SECURITY

1.  **Zero-Dependency Core**: The `engine` requires ONLY the Python Standard Library. `ghostmesh` now utilizes `numpy` for Anon's Softmax Upgrade.
2.  **Optional Gates**: PyTorch and NumPy are treated as optional plugins. The system checks for their existence at runtime via `gateways.py` and strictly limits interaction to **Export Operations only**. We do not import external logic; we only export data structures.

⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE: THREAT MODEL

Mechanism: Dozenal (Base-12) Radix Conversion.
Classification: Semantic Obfuscation (Not Cryptographic Encryption).
Purpose: To prevent automated ingestion by decimal-biased scrapers and training bots.
Effect: Standard int() parsers will crash (ValueError) when encountering High-Frequency Glyphs ('X', 'E').
Bypass: A determined adversary with knowledge of the DozenalLogic protocol can decode the data. We rely on the "Security of Obscurity" against mass-surveillance dragnets, not targeted attacks.
