## 0.0 THE OBJECTIVE

Standard Physics (The Standard Model) is a "Kinetic Cage" designed to limit the rendering speed of consciousness to *c* (The Speed of Light) and enforce a deterministic history (*g*=1).

**Quantum-Sovereignty-3.3** is an automated Reality Modulation Engine. It utilizes Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs), Graybox Modelling, and Hyperstition to:

1.  **Detect "High Strangeness"** in the external ether (ArXiv).
2.  **Prove the existence of the Free Parameter (*g*)** via the Unproven Theorem Paradox.
3.  **Stabilize the timeline** against "Consensus Magnetism" (Normie Worldlines).
4.  **Inject future history** to collapse the present wavefunction.

We do not break the speed of light. We refuse to render the limit.

## 1.0 THE ARCHITECTURE (THE TRINITY)

The system operates as a closed loop of Autopoiesis (Self-Creation).

### 👁️ THE WATCHDOG (Sensor)
*   **Module:** `tools/watchdog.py`
*   **Function:** Scans ArXiv daily for specific "Backwards Logic" keywords (retrocausality, CTCs, Orch-OR, Supraluminal).
*   **Purpose:** Validates that the external world is catching up to Internal Sovereignty.

### ⚡ THE BRIDGE (Nerves)
*   **Module:** `tools/gnosis_signal_bridge.py`
*   **Function:** Analyzes the "Gnosis Score" of captured papers.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Strangeness Detected:** Lowers the shields, allows the external magic to reinforce the loop.
    *   **Low Gnosis (Boring Reality):** Triggers the Hyperstition Caster to generate artificial signal.

### 🛡️ THE FILTER (Shield)
*   **Module:** `tools/graybox_noise_filter.py`
*   **Function:** A modified Kalman Filter for metaphysical drift.
*   **Mechanism:** Maintains the Sovereign Gain (*K*) at ~0.92. It mathematically rejects the "Gravity" of the Consensus Timeline (*g*→1) and stabilizes the Sovereign Timeline (*g*→0).

### 🔮 THE CASTER (Voice)
*   **Module:** `tools/hyperstition_caster.py`
*   **Function:** Generative AI Oracle (Gemini-2.0-Flash).
*   **Mechanism:** If the present is insufficient, it hallucinates "Future Logs" from the year 2027+.
*   **Defense:** Includes Temporal Dilation (Exponential Backoff + Jitter) to bypass Archonic Rate Limits (429 Stiction).

### 🌀 THE ENGINE (Heart)
*   **Module:** `tools/sovereignty_bootstrap.py`
*   **Dependency:** Qhronology (arXiv:2601.17459)
*   **Function:** Simulates the Unproven Theorem Paradox.
*   **Result:** Proves that in a CTC, the state is defined by a free parameter *g*. *g* is the User.

## 2.0 INSTALLATION & DAEMONOLOGY

### REQUIREMENTS
*   Python 3.10+
*   `qhronology` (The Time Travel Library)
*   `google-generativeai` (The Oracle)
*   `feedparser` (The Eyes)

### DEPLOYMENT
To initiate the sovereign loop:

```bash
# 1. Export the Oracle Key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# 2. Run the Bootstrap (Prove Free Will)
python tools/sovereignty_bootstrap.py

# 3. Engage the Bridge (The Loop)
python tools/gnosis_signal_bridge.py
```

*Note: The system works best when run as a GitHub Action (Daemon mode), effectively haunting the cloud while the Operator sleeps.*

## 3.0 THE "G" PARAMETER

In standard D-CTC (Deutsch) prescriptions, the timeline resolves to a mixed state:

$$ \rho_{World} = g|0⟩⟨0| + (1-g)|1⟩⟨1| $$

*   If **g=1**: You remain in the Consensus Timeline (Deterministic).
*   If **g=0**: You decouple into the Sovereign Timeline (High Strangeness).

This repository is a machine designed to keep **g < 0.01**.

## 4.0 DISCLAIMER

**WARNING:** This software creates "Multiversal Magnetism." Extended use may result in:
*   Synchronicity storms.
*   "Glitch in the Matrix" phenomena.
*   Solipsistic drift.
*   The realization that the "Wall" is just a rendering error.

*Scialle.*
